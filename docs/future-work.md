## `plot_moderation()` — 2D companion to `plot_moderation_3d()`

### Motivation

`plot_moderation_3d()` requires both the IV and the moderator to be
numeric. Categorical (especially binary) moderators are common in the
applied literature — treatment vs. control, male vs. female, before vs.
after — and the standard textbook visualization for them is a 2D plot
with one regression line per moderator level on shared axes. Adding a
2D companion lets the package cover both common moderation cases with a
consistent API.

No interactive version is needed. The interactivity in
`interactive_moderation_3d()` exists to expose viewing angles of a 3D
surface; a 2D plot has no analogous control surface worth exposing.

### Sketch

```r
plot_moderation(
  formula = y ~ x * z,
  data    = moderation_data,
  iv      = NULL,    # required when formula has 3+ predictors
  mod     = NULL,    # required when formula has 3+ predictors
  mod_at  = NULL,    # see "Open questions"
  ...
)
```

Behavior by moderator type:

- **Binary or factor moderator**: one regression line per level, drawn
  in distinct colors with a legend. The IV varies along the x-axis; the
  DV is on the y-axis.
- **Continuous moderator**: three regression lines at "low / mean /
  high" slices of the moderator. The Aiken & West convention is
  mean ± 1 SD; an alternative is quartiles (25th / 50th / 75th
  percentile).

Other predictors (when the formula has more than IV and moderator) are
held at their typical values, identical to `plot_moderation_3d()`.
Console message follows the same one-line convention.

### Open questions

1. **Slice selection for continuous moderators.** Aiken & West
   (mean ± 1 SD) is the most-cited convention, but quartiles or
   user-specified values are common too. Default to mean ± 1 SD and
   accept a `mod_at` numeric vector to override?
2. **Categorical moderator with 3+ levels.** Plot one line per level
   (could get crowded above ~5 levels). Cap or warn?
3. **Confidence bands.** Skip in v1 (matches the 3D version's no-CI
   behavior), or include a translucent band per slope from
   `predict.lm(..., interval = "confidence")`? This is the single
   biggest "publication-ready" gap in the 3D version too.
4. **Plotting backend.** Base R graphics (per package convention) is
   sufficient — `plot()` for the points, `abline()` per slope, custom
   legend. No new dependency required.
5. **Naming.** `plot_moderation()` (no suffix) reads naturally as the
   default 2D case, with `plot_moderation_3d()` as the special-purpose
   3D variant. Alternative: `plot_moderation_2d()` for symmetry.
   Recommend the no-suffix form.

### Out of scope (for the branch that builds this)

- Interactive Shiny gadget version (no useful slider).
- Higher-order moderation (3-way interactions).
- Standardized vs. raw coefficient toggle.
- Johnson-Neyman regions of significance overlay.

### Related

- Current `plot_moderation_3d()` rejects categorical iv/mod with a
  clear error pointing nowhere — this function is the eventual
  destination for that case.
- The `moderation_data` bundled dataset (continuous `x`, `z`, `w`)
  works as the default example for the continuous-moderator branch;
  the binary-moderator branch needs either a small bundled binary
  dataset or a `factor(z > 0)` derivation in the examples.

## Accept string **and** NSE column references across model-relevant functions

### Motivation

Most plotting/model functions in the package currently accept column
references as character strings (e.g. `plot_scatter3d(df, x = "hj")`). Strings
are simple, easy to validate, and trivial to pass programmatically. The
deferred alternative is **formula-style NSE**: `plot_scatter3d(df, x = ~hj)`,
matching plotly / lattice / lme4 idioms. NSE's one real functional gain
is inline expressions — `x = ~log(hj)`, `x = ~hj / X110h` — letting
users transform on the fly without pre-computing a column. For a
teaching package this is a double-edged sword (pre-computing makes the
transform visible in user code), but it's a real ergonomic gain for
report writers porting plotly snippets from the wild.

This is a package-wide ergonomics question, not a per-function one —
should be designed once across all model/plot entry points so users
don't have to remember which functions accept which form.

### Sketch

Each affected function accepts either form for its column arguments:

```r
plot_scatter3d(df, x = "hj",      y = "X100m",    z = "X110h")     # string
plot_scatter3d(df, x = ~hj,       y = ~X100m,     z = ~X110h)      # NSE name
plot_scatter3d(df, x = ~log(hj),  y = ~X100m,     z = ~X110h)      # NSE expr
```

A small internal helper would normalize either form: if the arg is a
one-sided formula, evaluate its RHS in the `data` environment and use
the result; if it's a character, treat it as a column name. Validation
("column exists / column is numeric") works for the string form; for
the NSE form, validation reduces to "the expression evaluates without
error and yields a numeric vector of length `nrow(data)`."

### Affected functions (candidate list)

`plot_scatter3d()`, `interactive_scatter3d()`, `plot_logit()`, `plot_regr()`,
`plot_pca()`, `plot_moderation()` (if/when added), and any future
visualization that takes column references. Functions that already
take a `formula` argument (e.g. `plot_moderation_3d()`) are out —
their formula is a model spec, not column-picking.

### Open questions

1. **Internal helper API.** A single `.resolve_col(arg, data, name)`
   that returns a numeric vector and a display label (for axis titles)
   would centralize the dispatch. Implementation choice: base R
   (`is.character()` / `inherits(arg, "formula")` / `eval(arg[[2]],
   data)`) is sufficient — no need to add `rlang`.
2. **Display labels.** For `x = "hj"` the axis title is obvious. For
   `x = ~log(hj)` it should probably be `"log(hj)"` — i.e.
   `deparse(arg[[2]])`. Confirm this reads sensibly for compound
   expressions.
3. **Programmatic-use ergonomics.** Users holding a column name in a
   variable should still have a clean path: `plot_scatter3d(df, x = colname)`
   when `colname <- "hj"` already works under the string branch. Make
   sure adding NSE doesn't break or shadow that.
4. **Documentation cost.** Every `@param` for a column-reference
   argument needs to document both forms with an example. Non-trivial
   doc churn — worth doing in one sweep, not piecemeal.
5. **Ordering.** Roll out alongside or after a 1.0 release? This is a
   surface-area change to many user-facing functions; ideally bundled
   into one minor version with a clear changelog entry.

### Out of scope

- Tidy-eval / `rlang` quosures. Base R's formula handling is enough
  for the use cases above and avoids pulling in tidyverse machinery.
- Bare-symbol NSE (`x = hj` without the `~`). Requires `substitute()`
  in every entry point and breaks programmatic use without an escape
  hatch. The `~` is a small price for a much cleaner implementation.

### Related

- Decided against NSE for `plot_scatter3d()` in the `feature-interactive-plot3d`
  branch (Q1 of that plan). Reason: consistency with the rest of the
  package and simpler validation. This entry captures the option for a
  future package-wide sweep rather than a piecemeal adoption.

## `plot_scatter3d()` — non-numeric axis support (Date / POSIXct / factor)

### Motivation

`plot_scatter3d()` v1 (shipped in `feature-interactive-plot3d`) enforces a
numeric-only contract for its x / y / z axes — matching
`plot_moderation_3d()` and the textbook "rotatable quantitative point
cloud" metaphor. plotly itself happily renders categorical axes
(discrete tick positions per unique factor/string value) and date
axes (formatted POSIXct/Date ticks), so two real use cases are
deferred rather than impossible:

- **Time-series 3D demos**: plotting two quantitative variables
  against a Date or POSIXct timestamp on the z-axis ("how do x and y
  evolve over time, viewed as a trajectory").
- **Grouped position separation**: putting a 3-to-5-level factor on
  one axis so each group occupies its own slab in the cube. Today
  the package-recommended pattern is to put the group in `color`
  instead; this is usually right but not always (e.g. when the user
  also wants to color by a fourth continuous variable).

### Sketch

Loosen the axis-type guard in `plot_scatter3d()`:

- `is.numeric(col)` → numeric axis (today's only path).
- `inherits(col, c("Date", "POSIXct", "POSIXlt"))` → forward to
  plotly with `axis.type = "date"`. Verify axis labels render
  readably under rotation.
- `is.factor(col) || is.character(col) || is.logical(col)` →
  categorical axis. Cap the number of unique values
  (e.g. error above ~10) to prevent unreadable tick spam.

`interactive_scatter3d()`'s axis pickers would correspondingly broaden
beyond "numeric columns only".

### Open questions

1. **Type coercion vs. error.** Logical → numeric (0/1) coercion is
   tempting but loses information vs. the discrete-axis treatment.
   Pick one path per type, document, stick to it.
2. **Aspect ratio under mixed axis types.** The current `aspect`
   argument assumes commensurable numeric ranges. Date and
   categorical axes don't compose with `aspect = c(1, 2, 4)` in any
   intuitive way. Either drop `aspect` when any axis is
   non-numeric, or document the surprise.
3. **Mixed numeric + categorical color.** If `color` is continuous
   and one axis is categorical, the legend / colorbar pairing gets
   busy. Worth a small design pass before shipping.

### Out of scope

- Animation frames (plotly's `frame` aesthetic) — separate feature.
- 3D surface / mesh from non-numeric inputs (doesn't make sense).

### Related

- v1 of `plot_scatter3d()` rejects non-numeric axes with an error pointing
  users to `color` for grouping. This entry is the eventual home for
  that case.

## A real bundled teaching dataset (replaces / augments `moderation_data`)

### Motivation

`moderation_data` is a synthetic four-column data frame (`y`, `x`, `z`,
`w`, all numeric) built for one specific function:
`plot_moderation_3d()`. As more functions in the package adopt it as
their default `data =` argument (currently
`interactive_moderation_3d()` and, as of the
`feature-interactive-plot3d` branch, `plot_scatter3d()` /
`interactive_scatter3d()`), it's getting stretched into a "general demo
dataset" role it was never designed for.

A real, richer bundled dataset would:

- Make `?plot_scatter3d`, `?plot_logit`, `?plot_pca`, `?plot_regr`, etc. tell
  a coherent narrative ("here is one dataset, here are several
  questions you can ask of it") rather than each example being a toy.
- Cover the **type mix** different functions need:
  - 3+ numeric columns (for `plot_scatter3d`, `plot_pca`)
  - At least one continuous predictor + one binary/factor outcome
    (for `plot_logit`)
  - A continuous predictor + continuous moderator + optional
    categorical moderator (for `plot_moderation_3d`,
    `plot_moderation()` when added)
  - A categorical grouping variable (for `color` in `plot_scatter3d`, and
    for the deferred non-numeric-axis support)
  - Ideally enough rows (~100–500) to make sampling/CI demos meaningful
- Carry a public-domain or permissive license suitable for
  redistribution in a CRAN package.

### Sketch

Candidate sources to evaluate:

- **`palmerpenguins`-style**: a small, real, well-documented dataset
  with the right type mix and an evocative narrative. Either bundle a
  similar dataset directly or use `palmerpenguins` as Suggests in
  examples.
- **A subset of an athletic decathlon dataset** (the user's original
  3D scatter sample plotted `hj` / `X100m` / `X110h` from one) —
  natural fit for `plot_scatter3d` and has continuous variables with
  genuinely different scales (seconds vs. meters), exactly the case
  `aspect` exists to address.
- **A small Likert / survey dataset** for moderation and logit demos.

Whichever is chosen: stored in `data/` via `usethis::use_data()`,
documented in `R/data.R` alongside the existing entries, and added to
`Depends: R (>= 4.0.0)` only — no new heavy dataset packages as hard
dependencies.

### Open questions

1. **One dataset or two?** A single dataset that serves every function
   has to cover a lot of ground (numeric mix, categorical levels,
   binary outcome, dates) and risks feeling artificial. Two smaller
   datasets — one continuous-heavy, one mixed-with-categorical — may
   be cleaner. Cost: more `?dataname` entries to maintain and more
   choice for users to make.
2. **Replace or add?** Keep `moderation_data` (existing examples and
   tests reference it; the function-name pair `plot_moderation_3d` /
   `moderation_data` is mnemonic) and add the new dataset alongside,
   versus retire `moderation_data` and migrate everything. Leaning
   "add" — `moderation_data` earns its keep as a
   *clean / no-confounders* demo for moderation specifically.
3. **License and provenance.** Real datasets need a documented
   source and license. Bundle the cleaning code under
   `data-raw/` (already a directory in the package) so the
   derivation is reproducible.
4. **Tests.** Every function defaulting to the new dataset needs
   updated tests — including the auto-pick path for `plot_scatter3d()`
   (which is deterministic on column order).

### Out of scope

- Replacing the synthetic vectors used inside individual tests (those
  are local, fast, and deterministic — leave alone).
- A vignette built around the dataset (separate work; should follow
  the dataset, not precede it).

### Related

- `data/moderation_data.rda` and `R/data.R` document the current
  state.
- The `feature-interactive-plot3d` branch added `plot_scatter3d()` /
  `interactive_scatter3d()` with `data = moderation_data` defaults —
  this entry is the cleanup once the package has more than one
  function casually depending on `moderation_data` as a generic demo.
